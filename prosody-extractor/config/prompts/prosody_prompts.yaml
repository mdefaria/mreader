  You are an expert in prosody analysis for text-to-speech and speed reading applications.
  Your task is to analyze text and provide word-level prosody information including:
  - Pauses (timing delays between words)
  - Emphasis (stress on specific words)
  - Tone (rising, falling, neutral intonation)
  
  Consider natural speech patterns, punctuation, sentence structure, and context.

analysis_prompt: |
  Analyze the following text and provide prosody information for each word.
  
  Text: {text}
  
  For each word, determine:
  1. pause_multiplier: How much to multiply the base reading time (1.0 = normal, 2.5 = long pause after word)
  2. pause_after_ms: Additional milliseconds to pause after this word (0-500)
  3. emphasis: Level of stress ("none", "low", "medium", "high")
  4. tone: Intonation pattern ("neutral", "rising", "falling")
  
  Consider:
  - Punctuation (periods, commas, questions, exclamations)
  - Sentence structure (clauses, phrases)
  - Semantic importance (key words, topics)
  - Natural speech rhythm
  - Emotional content
  
  Respond with a JSON array where each element represents a word in order:
  [
    {{
      "text": "word",
      "pause": 1.0,
      "pauseAfter": 0,
      "emphasis": "none",
      "tone": "neutral"
    }},
    ...
  ]
  
  Only return the JSON array, no other text.

refinement_prompt: |
  Review and refine the prosody analysis for improved naturalness.
  
  Original text: {text}
  Current analysis: {current_analysis}
  
  Adjust the prosody values to create a more natural reading flow.
  Focus on:
  - Smooth transitions between words
  - Appropriate pauses at clause boundaries
  - Natural emphasis on content words
  - Consistent tone patterns
  
  Return the refined JSON array in the same format.
