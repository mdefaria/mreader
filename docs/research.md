# 📚 Research Concepts for Cognitive-Paced Reading (Prosody-Aware RSVP)

## ✅ Core Concept

Turning reading into a flow that matches **inner speech**, not a fixed external pace. The goal is to align reading with the **way we think**, restoring rhythm, pauses, and natural processing.

---

## 🔍 Relevant Research Areas & Terminology

### 1. Implicit Prosody

* Readers internally assign rhythm, stress, and intonation while reading.
* RSVP disrupts this rhythm.
* Goal: **algorithmically restore natural pacing**.

Keywords:

* `implicit prosody`
* `silent reading prosody`
* `prosodic boundary detection`

---

### 2. Cognitive Load Theory (Reading)

* Fixing pacing = increased **extraneous load**
* Natural pauses improve comprehension and working memory usage.

Keywords:

* `cognitive load reading`
* `working memory language processing`

---

### 3. Temporal Cognition

* How humans perceive and align cognitive time.
* Relevant to **precise timing** between chunks of text.

Keywords:

* `temporal attention reading`
* `time perception in language processing`

---

### 4. Stream-of-Consciousness Cognition

* Narrative style that reflects raw thought structure.
* Supports **self-narration and inner voice flow**.

Keywords:

* `stream of consciousness reader cognition`
* `inner voice narrative processing`

---

### 5. Adaptive/Human-Centered RSVP

* Emerging niche: RSVP that understands **phrasing** and **emotion**.
* Uses NLP or ML to adjust pacing.

Keywords:

* `adaptive RSVP`
* `prosody-aware text display`
* `cognitive speed-reading systems`

| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Fixed timing           | Variable, **meaning-aware** timing |
| Robotic delivery       | Inner-voice aligned                |
| Reduces comprehension  | Boosts **flow + understanding**    |
| Ignores natural pauses | Uses punctuation + semantic cues   |

## 📝 Roadmap for Prototype & Study

1. **Baseline RSVP**
2. Add timing based on **punctuation**
3. Add **phrase/chunk detection**
4. Add NLP for **emotion/tension pacing**
5. Measure comprehension vs standard RSVP

Target metrics:

* Reading speed
* Comprehension score
* Subjective flow / comfort
* Cognitive load indicators
